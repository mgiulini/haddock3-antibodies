# Sets of PDB files

This folder contains the following subfolders:
- **Structure_paper_pdbs** : all the haddock3-ready pdb files extracted from [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31727476/). For each pdb, there is the
  ligand unbound form (*PDB_l_u.pdb*), the receptor unbound form (*PDB_r_u.pdb*) and the corresponding bound target (*target-PDB.pdb*), where the
  first chain corresponds to the receptor (antibody)
